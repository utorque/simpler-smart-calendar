# TODOS

## NEXT TODO
- [ ] POTENTIALLY FIXED ? add the current date and time to the planner so it does not plan things for too early
- [ ] global user config (breaks, breaks after tasks,...)
- [ ] fully redo the UI to be nicer, more responsive, softer to the eye while prioritizing UX- Potentially change the stack ?
- [ ] redo ai api to be generic / use mistral or cheaper & less energy intensive models

## GOOD FEATURES
- [ ] direct filter on task list to see only X or Y places
- [ ] button to reschedule only for current filter

## PLANNED

## MAYBE LATER
- [ ] task button add context and re-plan
- [ ] button to automatically do docker-compose pull and docker-compose up -d from the web app (supersecure lol)
- [ ] add a done button or sth
- [ ] get all tasks for context or something ?  
- [ ] add learn user habits   
- [ ] optimize system prompt

## MEH
- [ ] Potentially going all in in project management ?

## DONE
- [x] add space id and not name directly to change name lol
- [x] Make AI return list of tasks instead of just one necessarily
- [x] Drag task edge on calendar to change time
- [x] way to see tasks finished
- [x] ctrl click to mark task done
